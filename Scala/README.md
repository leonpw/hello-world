## Getting Started

 Before you start installing Scala on your machine, you must have Java 1.8 or greater installed on your computer.

### Installing Scala binaries

* Windows: Install [Scala binaries](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/).
 

### Running Scala code
Open a command prompt and `cd` to the folder containing your `hello-world.scala` file.

In the command-prompt window, enter the following command to run the program:

`scala hello-world.scala`

**Congratulations! You've run your first Scala program!**
